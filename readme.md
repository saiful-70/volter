# How to run
* run the command to download the repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/saiful-70/volter.git
```
* double click __index.html__ to see output.
* run the command to install the only one repository I used __node-sass__
```sh
npm install
```

# Just Saying

It was an __PSD__  file, I just converted it to __HTML__ for practice purpose. There's not added any interactivity unless the mobile menu and some hover effect. For layout I used __FLEXBOX__. That's it.
